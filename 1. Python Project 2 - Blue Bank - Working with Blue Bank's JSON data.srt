1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,320
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,280
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,230
Okay, so last lecture.

4
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,770
We finished off our first project, and now in this lecture, we are going to be doing our second project.

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:16,650
And our second project is a loan analysis by a company called Blue Bank.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,970
So I'm going to open the project brief and we can give it a read.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:30,660
Okay, so this is the project brief, which will be available in your class lecture notes and we can

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,980
scroll down to project two.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,040
All right, let's give it a read.

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,280
Blue Bank is a bank in USA that has a loan department which is currently understaffed.

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:48,330
They supply loans to individuals and don't have much reporting on how risky these borrowers are using

12
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,380
Python and Tableau.

13
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,260
I'd like to see a report of borrowers who may have issues paying back the loan, and those are the data

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:55,860
files.

15
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,550
So you should have downloaded the data files.

16
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,850
Remember to download them and save them into one folder for this whole course just so we can refer back

17
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,120
to it.

18
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,680
And then let's just go on to Python.

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:13,310
Okay.

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,000
So I've opened Spider and first things first.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,930
So make sure that your value in underscore sales pie folder.

22
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,900
If you still have it open, make sure that it's saved so you can command or control.

23
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,320
Yes.

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,690
Or save it using this icon.

25
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,730
Okay.

26
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,940
And then we can close it.

27
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,280
This intro to Python.

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,020
Like I said, you can keep it for notes.

29
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:39,440
Maybe.

30
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,190
And now let's open a new file.

31
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:47,550
Okay.

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,280
I want to open this file.

33
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,940
I want you to click on Save.

34
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:02,490
And let's call it Blue Bank, dot pie.

35
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,600
And click save.

36
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,280
Okay.

37
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:16,680
So you may have noticed that the file type that we are going to be working on for Blue Bank is a JSON

38
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,160
file.

39
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:27,660
So if you notice the extension in the project brief, which is here, you can see the extension is JSON.

40
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:35,130
So JSON is a file type that looks similar to dictionaries that we discussed in Project one.

41
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,650
I'll show you how JSON looks.

42
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,430
So I'm just going to open the actual dataset.

43
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:44,860
Okay.

44
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:51,790
And you can see that the Jason file has data enclosed in curly brackets.

45
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,120
Right.

46
00:02:52,420 --> 00:03:00,880
And each set of curly brackets have sort of the same keys, but just different values.

47
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,210
Right.

48
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:06,130
Essentially, a Jason files within the curly brackets.

49
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,680
This represents one row of data.

50
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,170
And these are the column names.

51
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,680
So it's just a different format and how we usually set up the data.

52
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,150
But I just wanted to show you how Jason files look.

53
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:27,490
Now in Python, the good thing is that Python does have a pre-installed package called Jason which can

54
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,980
actually read these types of files.

55
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,790
I'm just going back to Spider.

56
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:43,160
And what we can do is we can use a library called Jason to help us to read the files.

57
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,790
And while we importing Jason, we can also import pandas to remember for libraries.

58
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,460
One is that you have to install them, and then two, you have to import them if you're going to use

59
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:54,580
it.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,170
Now what, Jason?

61
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,300
Jason comes prepackaged in Anaconda, so we're fine with that.

62
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,420
We don't need to do a pipe install, Jason.

63
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,910
We just need to imported into our script.

64
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:13,900
But if you remember, for Pandas, we had to do a puppy install pandas in our command, prompt a terminal

65
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,150
K, which is this year,

66
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,940
and then import it into a python.

67
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,580
But for Jason, we don't need to do that.

68
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,350
So we can just have some libraries.

69
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,180
So let's just say import Jason.

70
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:38,450
And as always, import pandas as PD.

71
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:47,990
Usually the way scripts are set out is that your libraries occur first, most in your script, and then

72
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,800
you actual script.

73
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:54,980
The other thing to note is to note that I didn't bring up in the last project is that you must be very

74
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,220
careful with spacing an indentation on Python.

75
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,330
It means a lot.

76
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:08,030
So if you are going to space, you know, or tab, make sure that you're doing it for a specific reason

77
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,200
and not just randomly.

78
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,260
All right.

79
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,510
So now that we do that, let's try and read our JSON data.

80
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,840
So there's two ways we can do that.

81
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:30,320
And I'm just going to come in here and say method one to read JSON data.

82
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,000
Okay.

83
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:49,250
So are we going to say Jason file as equal to and say open and then open brackets?

84
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,370
Karma and whatever the file name is called.

85
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:02,380
So I'm just going to go to the file section here where the variable explorer is, and it is this one

86
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:02,680
here.

87
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,280
Okay.

88
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,590
Some type of such a lone underscore data.

89
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,690
Underscore Jason dot Jason.

90
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:18,610
Okay.

91
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,430
And then this here just opens a file, and then we need to actually load it.

92
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:34,660
All right, so then we're going to say data equals Jason load and adjacent file.

93
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,590
Okay, so this opens the Jason file.

94
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,410
So this is our JSON file and it opens it and this actually load data into Python.

95
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:44,710
Right.

96
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:52,030
So the function there's a load function in the Jason library where we can open a file.

97
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:53,610
Okay.

98
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,500
So let's just go back to Variable Explorer.

99
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,060
Okay.

100
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:05,700
And also just to note, this is so similar to how we do the pandas functions as well.

101
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:13,720
If you remember correctly, the last project as well, if you're referring to a function in pandas,

102
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,910
the function name would be here and then pandas would be here and then whatever the function does.

103
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,190
So that formatting stays the same.

104
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:22,250
Okay.

105
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,000
So in this instance, we're using Jason.

106
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,920
Jason has a load function and we're loading Jason file.

107
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,270
What is Jason File?

108
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,590
Jason file is just opening the specific directory.

109
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,230
Okay, let's just run the script.

110
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,390
You can run the whole script.

111
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:43,900
Awesome.

112
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:44,440
Okay.

113
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:51,190
And now you see we have a list and our data file here.

114
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:51,600
All right.

115
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,920
And it looks like there is that same data that we saw when we are looking at the JSON data.

116
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,480
Let's double click on it.

117
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:00,560
Okay.

118
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:05,770
Definitely not in a data frame or table, which is what we like.

119
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,670
So we definitely need to work on the formatting here.

120
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:19,000
The other method we can do to load adjacent file, it's very similar to the first one.

121
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,980
Just a different format that you might see.

122
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,790
As we use the word statement.

123
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,670
So if we say something like a wolf and then we say Open.

124
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,780
Loan data.

125
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,520
Jason Dot.

126
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,440
Jason

127
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,530
as.

128
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:45,970
Jason File.

129
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,370
Data equals Jason.

130
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,290
Dirt load.

131
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,070
Jason.

132
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,280
Well.

133
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,590
And just do a print print data.

134
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,180
Okay.

135
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,220
Now, this is a bit different.

136
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:15,900
But basically over here we can use something called well and s to declare a variable in another way.

137
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:23,720
So this here was and as is the same as saying Jason file equals open long data.

138
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,050
Jason.

139
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,570
Jason.

140
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,160
Right.

141
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,250
But because it's a word statement, there needs to be some sort of formatting specifics.

142
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:31,650
Okay.

143
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:40,150
So with this here, you'll notice that we put a colon and then immediately went up into Python indented.

144
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,990
So there's a tab between the beginning of the line until the next.

145
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,410
And.

146
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:53,150
Python uses indentations to actually separate sort of statements.

147
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,800
If I am describing it properly, so thus here, whatever is indented, whatever is tabbed is all part

148
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,130
of this.

149
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,120
What statement?

150
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:02,870
Okay.

151
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,900
And then once I move out of the indentation.

152
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,560
So once I go back, it's not part of the statement.

153
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,180
Right.

154
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,140
So ideally, this here means the same as this.

155
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,750
We just writing it differently.

156
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:22,670
So over here, we're saying with open lone date, adjacent, adjacent as JSON file.

157
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,750
Same thing as saying JSON file equals open load data to date.

158
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,320
Jason.

159
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,540
And then this is exactly the same.

160
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:29,990
All right.

161
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,570
This data equals JSON load.

162
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,970
Jason file and then I just added a print function, but you actually don't need to have that.

163
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,350
So I'm going to remove that

164
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,370
and let's run this and see if there's any difference.

165
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:51,380
I'm just selecting from method two down and just run the selection.

166
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:54,470
Okay.

167
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,760
And exactly the same.

168
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,710
Exactly the same method.

169
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,100
Okay.

170
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:05,090
I added it in because this is what you might see and sometimes you may want to use this as well.

171
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:11,120
This is also quite good if you want to do any transformations as well and you keep it all within the

172
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,540
same.

173
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,530
The statement.

174
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,830
And then generally what statements are used to make your code clean and readable.

175
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:27,650
And then so so it actually executes better if there are any errors as well.

176
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:32,750
So you'll you will see people using this more than than using this one.

177
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,780
But for now, just it's up to you.

178
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,770
It does the same thing.

179
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,200
Yeah, right.

180
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:47,690
So I know that this is now stored into a list and it actually does look a bit like a dictionary as well.

181
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:58,580
And what the lists here they are sort of for different types or ways Python uses to store collections

182
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,270
of data.

183
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:04,790
There's lists, there's tuples visits and there's dictionaries.

184
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,420
All right.

185
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:13,580
And like I said before, to create a list, they generally are created out of square brackets, whereas

186
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,420
tuples are on brackets and states are curly brackets.

187
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:22,310
So I'm just going to go a bit more in detail into lists.

188
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:29,030
So let's just say we're going to create a list, let's call it lists, and we're going to say it equals

189
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,970
two and let's do Apple.

190
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,180
Banana and pear.

191
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,250
And let's run this.

192
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,570
So let's select that line and run it.

193
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,260
Okay.

194
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,630
So now we have a.

195
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,310
We know this strain, this list, and it's apple.

196
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:56,910
Banana and pear lists are generally ordered and changeable as well.

197
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,420
And you can also have duplicate values.

198
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,150
So if we have another one called pear.

199
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:11,840
And I'm just selecting and I'm doing an if nine or just running the selection.

200
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:13,690
Yeah.

201
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,010
It still allows it.

202
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,830
Everything's good.

203
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:20,300
There's there's no era right now for lists.

204
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,810
The first item has an index zero.

205
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,330
The second item has an index one.

206
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,650
The third item has an index two and and so on.

207
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:37,700
So let's just go to a console and let's just say if we had to do something like List zero, which is

208
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,370
going to my console because I do want to continuously run this.

209
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:46,970
But if we do something else sorry it's not listed the lists zero and press enter.

210
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:53,480
I can see Apple shows up and let's do lists too.

211
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,750
And you can see here shows up.

212
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:57,950
Okay.

213
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:06,130
So we can actually choose specific items in the list using that sort of method of referencing the other

214
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,680
index.

215
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:17,330
Now remember I told you that lists are ordered and changeable and allow duplicate values, right?

216
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:23,870
What that means is that if I want to add a new item to this list, it will get added at the back of

217
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,200
the list.

218
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,360
So it's not going to change the order.

219
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:33,140
Okay, so let's just look at it in a bit more detail and let's do something like it's a pinned to a

220
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:33,530
list.

221
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:36,670
Okay.

222
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,740
And we're going to do something like lists dot append.

223
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,540
So append is a function way.

224
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,400
If you want to add, something usually gets added to the end and I do want to add a new fruit.

225
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,870
So let's add cherry.

226
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,310
Okay.

227
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,350
And let's run this.

228
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,180
Okay.

229
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,470
And now you'll see Cherry is added, but you'll see cherries added at the end.

230
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:13,200
So if we do a print list here, so let's do a print lists and you can see cherry is added at the end.

231
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:22,200
Now, what if we actually want to insert maybe another fruit into a specific position?

232
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:23,570
Okay.

233
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,110
All we can do is, let's say, insert.

234
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:37,140
Then insert item into a specific position.

235
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:39,540
Okay.

236
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,820
We're going to do lists dot insert.

237
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,730
And let's just say an index zero.

238
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,350
Let's say an index number one.

239
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,380
I want to insert grape.

240
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,540
Okay.

241
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,240
So I'm going to an index number one.

242
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,520
I'm inserting a grape.

243
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,670
So this is zero.

244
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,330
This is one.

245
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:10,110
So instead of banana, it's all going to shift down and it's going to be apple grape, banana pear here

246
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,430
or apple grape.

247
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,740
Banana, papaya, cherry.

248
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,320
So let's run this.

249
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:26,150
And let's have a look at the lists again.

250
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,380
And there you go.

251
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,650
Apple, grape, banana, papaya, cherry.

252
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:42,830
But also a good thing with lists that are not present in in other collections or data types like us

253
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,160
yet.

254
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:54,240
It's

255
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:03,070
also a good thing with lists that maybe are not present in something like a tuple is that you can actually

256
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,960
change items in a list list.

257
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:18,000
Also a good thing with lists that are actually not present in something like a tuple is that you can

258
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,270
actually change items in a list as well, which is pretty cool.

259
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:28,380
So you can change change items in a list.

260
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:37,950
So if we're going to do something like let's well, let's maybe do remove threats to remove so let's

261
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,900
remove items in the list first.

262
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:50,520
So we're going to say list, let's remove and I want to remove the duplicate pair.

263
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:52,850
Okay.

264
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,020
So let's run that.

265
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,350
And it's flipping lists in a console.

266
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,950
Now you can see Pier is removed.

267
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:18,340
Now the other thing we can do is we can also remove the last item.

268
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:25,770
So if we do lists dot pop.

269
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,930
PUP is a function that removes the last item.

270
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,320
So let's look at that and let's run that.

271
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,000
And I think.

272
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,620
Cherry's going to go.

273
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,730
So let's review lists.

274
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,450
And now you can see Cherry has been removed.

275
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,760
So something like Pop is quite useful.

276
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:59,430
You know, when you have a list of maybe email addresses or you're a data capture and you know you're

277
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:06,120
capturing data and you realize you made a mistake in your most recent data entry, you can use Pop.

278
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,310
So that's why I edited it.

279
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:12,240
And just because some people use Pop four for those specific reasons.

280
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,730
Let's just do background on lists.

281
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,390
I thought it would be nice to add because they are important.

282
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,060
I just couldn't find a way to fit it into our actual data for now.

283
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:27,390
It is quite important to remember because the lists honestly show up everywhere in Python.

284
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,140
So those are lists.

285
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:40,350
Now if you click into our data variable and we click into one of these values here,

286
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,310
we get this and we can all see Python is telling us the data type.

287
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,140
Yeah, it's saying that it's a dictionary.

288
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,120
Now, why is it a dictionary?

289
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,840
Well, it has a key and it has a value.

290
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,580
And dictionaries have keys, and they do have values.

291
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,210
Okay.

292
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,100
The other thing to notice about dictionaries is that you can store different types.

293
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,160
So this here policy, it's an integer.

294
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,910
The days with credit line is a float purpose.

295
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,070
Here is a string.

296
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:21,030
So dictionaries can have different types of data within them.

297
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:26,940
So how exactly do you create a dictionary and what can you do with a dictionary?

298
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,840
So let's just dive into that for a little bit as well.

299
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:36,180
So I want you to create a comment area and just say working with dictionaries.

300
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,190
And let's create a dictionary.

301
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,980
So let's call it my dict.

302
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:51,030
T is equal to and open a curly bracket.

303
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,640
Now just want to just space it out like that.

304
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,850
Give myself more space here.

305
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,420
Right.

306
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:07,560
And let's say something like name.

307
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,410
Colon.

308
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,750
Dee okay.

309
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,250
And the next one is location.

310
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,600
Colon, South Africa.

311
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:34,390
And then let's do something like fave color and red.

312
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:42,410
Just remove the remaining spaces and let's run this.

313
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,510
So just selected and run it.

314
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:47,780
Okay.

315
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:51,560
So when you run it, probably say something like invalid syntax.

316
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,810
So because we're missing a comma, so we need commas for dictionaries at the end of each line.

317
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:58,100
Okay.

318
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:58,880
Except red.

319
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,280
So in the last line, you don't need a comma.

320
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,620
And that's running again.

321
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:06,940
Okay.

322
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:07,840
There you go.

323
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,720
My addict has not shown up.

324
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:16,630
And you can see immediately it's a dictionary and it's telling us it has sort of three roles or three

325
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,260
keys.

326
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,990
Name, location and favorite color.

327
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,400
Now you can also store, like I said, a different data type.

328
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,840
So these are all strings or they all objects.

329
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:35,500
So if I just say a comma here and let's do something like lucky number.

330
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,510
Let's put seven and let's run this again.

331
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,490
So we had to put a comma here and we had to put a comma here.

332
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,380
We don't need to put it in the last line.

333
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,860
Okay, let's let and run that.

334
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,100
And you can see it works just as fine.

335
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,640
Even the lucky numbers seven and the rest are strings.

336
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:12,650
Now if we double click this can see the format here is that it has a key, it has a type a size and

337
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,840
a corresponding value.

338
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:24,200
Let's look at some other features of dictionaries so you can access other keys as well.

339
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,040
So

340
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,900
let's just say I just wanted to access maybe the color.

341
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:37,730
So I'm going to say color is equal to my dict.

342
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:46,790
And just like how it is in data frames, when you want to access a specific column, it's exactly the

343
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,180
same.

344
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,360
And it's just a print color.

345
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,440
And let's just run the these two lines.

346
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,040
Okay.

347
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,120
And you can see that color.

348
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,990
We now just extracted a specific key, which is color.

349
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,750
And it gave me what we wanted.

350
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:13,380
And then if ever we needed maybe a list of keys showing up, we can do that as well.

351
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:24,730
So let's say to get a list of keys, you can do something like my dict dot keys.

352
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,660
So let's just look at that and run it again.

353
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,710
And these are all the keys that are in my dict.

354
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,300
Similarly, if you want to get a list of values

355
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,180
to get a list of

356
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,150
values.

357
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,370
Okay.

358
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,490
Do my dict dot.

359
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,080
Okay.

360
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,070
And this values.

361
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,300
Let's run that.

362
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,070
So select that and run the selection.

363
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:08,770
Okay.

364
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,520
And these are all the values.

365
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,810
You can also get a list of items to get.

366
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:26,320
To get a list of items can save my ticket.

367
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,680
Dot items.

368
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,010
And let's run that.

369
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:35,980
Okay.

370
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,260
And these are just the individual items.

371
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,280
So name like each roll almost named location.

372
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:42,950
South Africa.

373
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:43,840
Favorite color red.

374
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,640
Lucky number seven.

375
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:51,160
And then the last thing we can also do that's quite cool is we can add a new variable.

376
00:25:51,160 --> 00:26:04,060
So to add when you key a new key variable, we can say very similar again to data frames.

377
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:11,770
My indicate gender is equal is equal to female.

378
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,010
Well, I can't spell today.

379
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,440
All right.

380
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,700
And it's just say print my dict can.

381
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,980
Let's just run the two lines.

382
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:31,740
Rookie error here needs to be in quotation marks.

383
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:43,770
And it's just run the two lines and now you can see gender appears and female and if we click the name

384
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:49,500
in the variable explorer can see gender appears and female.

385
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,700
Okay.

386
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:58,230
So you went a bit on a tangent, but I did want to note that because like I said, listen, dictionaries

387
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:02,640
are quite important and it's really good for you to understand those key concepts.

388
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,940
So back to the actual project.

389
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:12,420
Now we have our data in data in the file name or the variable name data.

390
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,470
It's a list.

391
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,420
It doesn't look great.

392
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,750
As you can see, we want it in a table form.

393
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,400
We want it in a data frame.

394
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:23,430
That's always the the good goal.

395
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,400
So we're going to work on that.

396
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:34,520
So before I do that, I just want to copy the our dictionary and list notes and I'm going to cut it

397
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:41,670
so you can command or control X or I click and say Cut, and I'm just going to post a pasted in my intro

398
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,380
to Python notebook.

399
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,830
So here, I'm just going to paste it here.

400
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,450
And I'm just going to come on to control S and save it.

401
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:54,330
Okay.

402
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:00,670
Just going to comment on just after the spot here.

403
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,100
I'm just going to say working with the lists.

404
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:05,800
Right.

405
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,270
All right.

406
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,080
And then save that.

407
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:16,090
And then just you can go back to blue bank pie, blue banker pie, and then you can save this as.

408
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,250
All right.

409
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:19,780
Okay.

410
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:26,020
So as I was saying, how would I transform this data file, which is a list?

411
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:32,260
And it's really an ugly format to work on to a nice data frame.

412
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:33,730
Okay.

413
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,500
So let's say transform to data frame,

414
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:49,330
let's say enter and let's call it loan data is equal to PDD.

415
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:50,980
Sounds familiar.

416
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,510
We know what PD is.

417
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,680
PD is pandas.

418
00:28:54,850 --> 00:29:03,670
Pandas has this really neat function called data frame, and it will transform your list to a data frame.

419
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:07,240
Okay, so what are we going to transform in this bracket?

420
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:11,710
Our list file, which is called data.

421
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:13,760
Okay.

422
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,880
Let's look at that and let's run that selection.

423
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:19,740
Awesome.

424
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,210
And now good news.

425
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,880
We can see loan data is quite nice.

426
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,560
It's in a data frame.

427
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,080
It has some rows, it has some columns.

428
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:33,450
And also we can see the column names.

429
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,490
So let's just double click on loan data.

430
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:48,250
And we can see all the columns are there and everything is looking good.

431
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:54,160
So before in this lecture, I just want to quickly let's just go over the columns.

432
00:29:54,490 --> 00:30:03,730
And I think also the columns are in the slide pack because they are quite there's a lot of abbreviations

433
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,240
in there.

434
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,720
So I'm just going to go through the columns.

435
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,130
Okay.

436
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,800
All right.

437
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,970
Let's go through this.

438
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,180
Okay.

439
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,310
So let's do it.

440
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,300
So we have created policy.

441
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:32,440
And from what I can tell, it's either a one or zero.

442
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:41,050
And one is if the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of blue bank and zero is if they don't.

443
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:49,090
So I think most people would be one because why would they be given a loan if they don't meet the actual

444
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,340
criteria for that loan?

445
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:00,610
There may be a few exceptions, but I think majority of these borrowers do meet that credit policy.

446
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,140
And I think each row of the data represents one borrower.

447
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:08,830
If that that helps.

448
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,370
Yeah.

449
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:21,030
The next one is purpose and the purpose of the borrower, why the borrower took or has taken the loan.

450
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:21,380
All right.

451
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:27,260
So debt consolidation, it's a credit card loan, home improvement.

452
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:30,230
So, you know, car loans, etc., would come through.

453
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:34,220
And in this small business, in this column.

454
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:39,650
So reasons to why the person took out their own interest rate.

455
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,210
So this is the interest rate of the loan as a proportion.

456
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:49,580
So a rate of 11% would be stored as 0.11.

457
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:57,500
And borrowers judged by Blue Bank to be more risky are assigned higher interest rates.

458
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:10,490
So obviously here, if a borrower is more risky, so maybe they don't have enough income to pay back

459
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:17,420
the loans or they haven't been paying back the loans, etc. Your interest rate will be higher than someone

460
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,740
who's very low risk.

461
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,870
They all have low interest rates.

462
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,480
Installment.

463
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:29,330
So this is the monthly installment owed by the borrower if the loan is funded.

464
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,790
So how much they pay each month?

465
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,780
Probably a minimum.

466
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:39,430
And these are in dollars, by the way, the long annual income.

467
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:44,930
So that is the natural log of the borrower's income for annual income.

468
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,770
So to get the actual annual income, we'll need to do the inverse.

469
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:53,780
So we'll need to get the exponent of this number will give us the actual annual income.

470
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:59,750
DTI is the debt to income ratio of the borrower.

471
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:04,220
So the amount of debt divided by the annual income.

472
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:04,910
Okay.

473
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:11,450
So obviously, if your DTI is greater than one, then your borrower has more debt than income, but

474
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,290
less than one.

475
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,620
Then you borrower has more income than debt.

476
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,190
All right.

477
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:25,910
It's I mean, this isn't really very accurate in general just because I mean, people's house loans

478
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:33,680
and stuff and mortgages all definitely make you get a higher DTI than your annual income because your

479
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:40,610
mortgage can be worth hundreds and thousands of dollars, but you're on your income much less than that.

480
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,910
So I'm just saying that this isn't the end all and be all.

481
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:50,990
Someone has a high DTI that could just be a normal, non risky borrower, but just have something like

482
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,770
a house loan

483
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,470
cycle that your FICO credit score.

484
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:02,630
So if you are in the U.S., you obviously know what it means if you're not in the US.

485
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:12,020
I think the US bases people's risk on credit score and if you applying for something like a house loan

486
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:18,590
or a car loan, etc., a good credit score will enable you to get the loan and a bad one is basically

487
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,910
you get blacklisted.

488
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,520
So for credit scores, I think it is anything.

489
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,180
So from 300 to 400 is very poor.

490
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,490
400 to 600 is poor.

491
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:35,110
600 to 660 is fair.

492
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,370
662 780 is good.

493
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:40,490
And 782 850 is excellent.

494
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:46,940
So basically anyone below 600 would be a poor credit, would have a poor credit score.

495
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,470
So these are in new lecture slides in case you want to refer back to them.

496
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:57,770
And then days with credit line is the number of days the borrower has had a credit line.

497
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:58,670
Okay.

498
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,160
So these look like quite decent sized loans.

499
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,370
So the credit line would be high.

500
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:10,760
I mean, these aren't short term like 30 day loans, revolving balance, borrowers revolving balance

501
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,420
or the amount unpaid at the end of the credit card billing cycle.

502
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,200
Okay.

503
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:25,250
So how much basically how much do they have left over again in revolving utility or utilization rate?

504
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:31,730
Is the borrower's revolving line utilization rate the amount of credit the line?

505
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,080
So the amount of credit line used relative to the total credit available.

506
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:44,540
So what this means is that so this person here has used only 25% of their total credit available, which

507
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:44,930
is good.

508
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,650
Inquiries within the last six months.

509
00:35:51,650 --> 00:36:00,200
This is if any sort of credit institutions have inquired the borrower about something like there's a

510
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,160
lot of inquiries.

511
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,100
There's an issue because of borrowers not paying or something's wrong.

512
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:15,020
So you don't want this to be populated that the number this is delinquency is a delinquency or de-link.

513
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,190
Two years.

514
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:22,880
I actually can't see in my notes the actual what's the full field name for this?

515
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:28,460
But this is the number of times a borrower had been 30 days past due on a payment in the past two years.

516
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:34,820
So if this is a high number, it means that the borough obviously is always late for his payment.

517
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:36,500
Okay.

518
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:43,030
Public records, the borrowers, number of derogatory public records.

519
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:50,660
So if they file for bankruptcy, texts, issues, judgments, etc., also, Don, this populated and

520
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:54,740
then with other loan has been partly fully paid or not as not fully paid.

521
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:55,630
Okay.

522
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,290
So quite a lot of data in this.

523
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:03,860
But you know, there's a lot we can tell whether borrower is a risky borrower or not.

524
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:07,960
I mean, just based, just based.

525
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,720
And the last few columns, we can actually give them quite good answers.

526
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:18,440
And then as you can see, we probably need to do a lot of transformation in cleaning here.

527
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:25,370
So, for example, these FICO scores, it would be good to actually have a column with the correct category

528
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,870
that the borrower is in.

529
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:31,640
So 680 is actually a good five COSCO.

530
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:37,050
So it would be nice to have a column like that.

531
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,050
It would be nice to get the actual annual income.

532
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:46,640
So we just need an exponent of this as well and and some other things that we can do.

533
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:48,900
Perfect.

534
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:49,740
Okay.

535
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:57,720
So using this and maybe if you want to go back to the slide deck and have a look at the fields again

536
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,360
you are most welcome to.

537
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:04,680
So they are present in the in the slide and the slides for the lecture.

538
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,530
But I think we are done here.

539
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,270
We know a bit more about the data.

540
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,320
We've loaded it in.

541
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,090
It's a nice data frame.

542
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,360
So in the next lecture, what we can do is you can get started on the data tuning and transformation.

543
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,010
So I'll see you then by.
